# House-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis

The prediction of house prices is a fundamental taskin the real estate industry, 
as it helps buyers, sellers, and real estate agents to make informed decisions.
I have created a machine learning model for house price prediction using a dataset of housing market data. 
The model is trained on a variety of features such as location, 
number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, among others. I have mainly utilized Linear Regression for this purpose.
Our analysis indicates that our linear 
regression model performs well, achieving a low mean squared error and high R-squared value on the test set.
